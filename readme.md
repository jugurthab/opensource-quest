# Opensource quest

Follow the opensource community and gather as much as you can of opensource blocks, pay attention to proprietary enemies blocks (*which do not play a fair play*).

Enjoy the game!!!!!!

    $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0
    $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev

## Compilation

A makefile will be available soon but one can :
